            <p2>The Lyon city didn't made itself in one day, named "LUGDUNUM" by Roman's Emperors
                the legend says that Juluis Ceasar climbed the Fouviere mount, just above the actual city of Lyon
                and said: "This is a great place to build the main city of Gaul". This was 2000 years ago and was apparently right!
                The Roman amphitheater stayed there trough the ages and welcome nowadays no more old Roman artists,
                but singers, music groups, and music festivals</a>.
